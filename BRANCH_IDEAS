Ideas for this branch:

I would like to clean up our code / database so we can start the ETC 2014 with a fresh install and a clean database.
I will remove anything that is not actively used at the moment (such as the categories table and related crap...) and
maybe even redo the migrations so only one create migration for each table exists, containing all the modifications so far.
